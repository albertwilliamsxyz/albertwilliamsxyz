					<p>Realize that you can start from scratch and then examine ideas.
					The more you do something the more you learn.
					Start with the content, then start giving it more details and work on its presentation and give more depth to it.</p>
					<h1>To Do</h1>
					<ul>
					<li>Look for a name for your website.</li>
					<li>Look for content to put in your website, maybe ideas or things like the ones you would keep in a journal?</li>
					<li>Do your math practice session.</li>
					<li>Continue working on the timer, that project seems pretty solid and you are really needing it right now, it would be great to have it.</li>
					<li>Think about the way in which you organize your activities.</li>
					<li>I think you should keep some sort of list of things to do, and refer to it whenever you do not have what to do or are bored.</li>
