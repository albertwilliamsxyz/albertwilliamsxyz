					<h2>Employment History</h2>
					<h3>Universidad Nacional Experimental de Guayana</h3>
					<p>Software Developer</p>
					<p>Guayana City, Bolívar June 2017 – July 2018 </p>
					<p>I was part of some project at my University, being a software developer as an intern. I gave some talks there, teaching about programming basics, general software development and helping students with their classes. Here, I was mostly helping with the maintenance of the administrative system with the help of some supervisors. </p>
					<h3>Omunzen Software</h3>
					<p>Technical Leader and Software Developer</p>
					<p>Guayana City, Bolívar </p>
					<p>October 2018 – October 2019 </p>
					<p>Software development, mainly working on microservices developed with Go, gRPC, Redis, Python, Mongodb, Node.js, OpenCV, Dart, Scikit, SQLite and Express. Here I've developed knowledge about computer vision, geolocation and related topics, creating and maintaining libraries used to feed services, and the services that made use of these libraries. </p>
					<h3>Dreamcode.io</h3>
					<p>Software Developer </p>
					<p>Quito, Pichincha - Ecuador</p>
					<p>October 2019 – November 2020</p>
					<p>Software developer, mainly working on serverless solutions, making use of technologies such as Typescript and NestJS for the backend, AWS for data storage, BI and deployment, MySQL as the database and git as the version-control software and Domain Driven Design as the approach for the definition of the solution. Learning a lot about software deployment, software architecture, good coding practices, automation scripts and, of course, serverless solutions.</p>
					<h3>Encora</h3>
					<p>Software Developer</p>
					<p>New York - USA</p>
					<p>November 2020 – November 2021 </p>
					<p>Software developer. Here I’ve been working with Python, Django, PostgreSQL, React, Typescript and Javascript. Working with a customer for which we have built a set of applications to automate and improve the experience of companies for which we offer compliance services. We have built an amazing set of tools such as SQL API to let the user create queries in our own language, creating an abstraction over our protected resources, so that the user doesn’t have to deal with low level stuff. Also, I have created some integrations here with third party applications using OAuth, such as Datadog, Github, Gitlab and Jira. Giving the user an amazing experience, in which he only needs to give us access to some resources logging into these applications, and we extract all the data and show it in a user-friendly format, and also, supporting some extra tools that can be used for audits. These integrations can be accessed through the SQL layer also, so that if the user wants specific pieces of data in some custom representation, they can write the query in our language and we process it for them.</p>
					<h3>Laika</h3>
					<p>Senior Software Engineer</p>
					<p>New York - USA</p>
					<p>November 2021 – Present </p>
					<p>Software developer. When I was working at Encora, I was working on a project for Laika. I was the first developer to join the team from Encora. When my contract ended at Encora, I was going to sign again for them but Laika wanted me on the team working directly for them, so they gave me a proposal and I accepted after a little negotiation with both companies. Since this is the same project as before, so is the technology stack, Python, Django, PostgreSQL, React, Typescript and Javascript. Working on integrations with third parties to fetch data from them and use them for audit purposes.</p>
