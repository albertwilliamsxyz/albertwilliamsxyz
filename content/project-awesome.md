# Project Awesome

Today I wanted to talk about a project that I find really interesting, the [Project Awesome](https://project-awesome.org/). It's a curated list of resources about different topics, most of them on computer science. The reason why I consider this to be a valuable project is due to the fact that most of the times we are limited, not only by what we do not know, but by what we do not know that we do not know. There will always be things that we will not know, but whenever we are learning a new topic, it is useful to try to check the scope of the topic we are studying to develop the insight that will let us see the big picture and how the ideas and pieces of knowledge that we're getting fit into that image. That is where the Project Awesome turns out to be useful, because it gives us both a list of high-quality resources and an index that helps us develop part of the insight that I was mentioning before.
